Name Brainstorming: 

Here is what I think of when I think of this project. I haven't deleted any name idea's I've had. 

What is it: A listing of projects, a connection between doers and those who want things done. It shows you what you can do, and what you've done. 
It's all about doing. 


It's about what you've done:
a record of progress
Milestones
footprints? 
tread marks?
tread.



it is a record showing the torn up underbrush from where the creators and innovators of our society form the path less traveled.

underbrush?
	bad
plt?
	(for path less traveled) This is also bad. 


sparks. 
	probably taken, but I like it. 

It's a connection between doers and those who need things done.
Weld? 
	Taken, but perhaps a variant? 
	Welder? Weld.Me? WeldTight? These are bad so far. But it glimmers with possibility 
fit? 
	sounds like a dating service, so no. 
	
Miradi is untaken, and swahili for projects. 
newject is untaken

doables.com is taken, but by one of those places that saps up tons of domains, so it might be cheap.

doing.com -- similar

Ploark.com isn't taken. 
We could have Ploarks, with ploark lists and things... 
I don't know. It doesn't sound tremendously awful. 

similarly with scarcht.com
